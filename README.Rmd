# `wavfeatures`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `wavfeatures` is to extract features of a `.wav` file. For now, it is just the syllable nuclei.

## Installation

You can install the development version of wavfeatures like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tysonstanley/wavfeatures")
```


## Example

This is a basic example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(wavfeatures)
get_syllables_ps(path)
```

Can use other arguments to control the calculations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_syllables_ps(path, threshold = -30, keep_intermediates = TRUE)
```
